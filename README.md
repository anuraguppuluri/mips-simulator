# mips-simulator

This is a C++ program that simulates the execution of a MIPS program. The simulator reads a "binary" file that contains hexadecimal representations of the text and initialized data segments. The program utilizes only a subset of the MIPS R2000 instruction set. In general, the program performs the fetch-execute cycle, reading instructions from memory, decoding them, and performing the appropriate operation on "simulated" registers and/or memory.

Since memory cannot be allocated in the simulator as a single linear array, three separate arrays have been allocated for the text, static data and stack segment, respectively. Instructions and static (initialized) data are read from the "binary" file into the corresponding simulator array. It is assumed that the text segment will not exceed 2 kilobytes (2*1024), the static data segment will not exceed 4 kilobytes, and the stack segment will not exceed 2 kilobytes. From the program's perspective, the text segment begins at address `0x00400000` and the static data segment begins at address `0x10010000`. The program expects a valid stack pointer at address `0x7fffefff`, (so the first valid aligned stack address is `0x7fffeffc`, which is the value the stack pointer has when the program begins execution). When the program accesses one of these segments, the appropriate offset into the "simulated" segment is computed.

The hex code accepted by the program may be generated with QtSpim. Also, the results produced by QtSpim may be compared with those produced by this simulator program for evaluating it. These binary input files containing the hex code need to have a marker (DATA SEGMENT) that indicates where the code (text) segment ends and the static data segment begins; the simulator jumps to loading the data into address `0x10010000` at that point. Also, to avoid including all 4K entries of the static data segment, the input file need only list those which are not 0; it needs to list their addresses followed by the data in word-aligned format. As an example, the assembly program "sum.s", which computes the sum of 9 numbers, lists as follows:

## Instructions Simulated

syscall codes 1,4,5,8,10, (read/write int, read/write string, and exit) have been simulated. Floating point and coprocessor instructions have not been simulated. As actual hardware is being simulated, pseudoinstructions (like LI: load immediate, or MOVE) which are translated by the assembler into actual instructions (usually ORI: or immediate in the case of LI) are not simulated â€” only "real" instructions with an opcode have been simulated. Pseudoinstructions may be used in the input binary files themselves, as the assembler will continue to make all the translations QtSpim would make (please use corresponding opcodes and instruction formats).

The actual gate-level hardware execution of each individual operation has also not been simulated. For example, to simulate ADD r3, r4, r5, the + operator in C++ has been used to perform r3 = r4 + r5, where r3, r4, and r5 are "simulated" registers. Similarly, *, /, -, ^, <<, >>, etc., have been used to "simulate" instruction execution.

Input binaries terminate by using the exit syscall. The entire binary is executed and all the register contents are printed at the end.
